In order to work together, we discussed how to combinate owr designs from the previous exercise.
Finally we decided to choose the code of Naama as is.
The reasons are:
1) We chose it because this code is orgenized in more arranged way.
i.e. Naama used OOP, so in the future, when we will be asked to use gui or write special logic, this will be much more
easy to implement, by using the "Logic" abstruct class. In addition, if we will be asked to implement another kind of player,
like the AIPlayer, we will use the "Player" abstruct class.
2) Beyond that, owr codes are very alike. We both used the same ideas to write the logic of owr functions, so it wasn't
necessary to change the function that Naama implemented to function that Tchelet implemented.
